# Home Assistant Add-on: Hewalex2MQTT by lzx

Hewalex devices are equipped with empty RS485 connectors. This is basically a serial port. This script uses a 'serial for url' connection.

You can buy a (cheap) wifi 2 rs485 or ethernet 2 rs485 device wich you attach to the rs485 port you want to interface with. And you need a piece of wire with 4 strands.
Heat pumps (PCWU) setup

Remove the plastic case and open up the "fuse box". In here you will find a free rs485 connector. Remove it and screw in a 4 strand wire. Connect the wire to the rs485wifi device. Make sure you connect them correctly. It is wise to measure ac and grnd to be sure!

In the controller, navigate to rs485 settings. Change baud rate to 38500, Actual address to 2 and Logic address to 2.

Setup the rs485-to-wifi device. Make sure baud settings match above settings. It is probably wise to assign static ip-address. Take note of this.
Solar pumps (ZPS) setup

Remove G-422 controller from the casing. Connect the RS485 port on the backside of the G-422 controller to the wifi controller.
